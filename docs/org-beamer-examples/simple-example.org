* This is the first structural section

** Frame 1

*** Thanks to Eric Fraga                                           :B_block:
    :PROPERTIES:
    :BEAMER_COL: 0.48
    :BEAMER_ENV: block
    :END:
    
    for the first viable Beamer setup in Org

*** Thanks to everyone else                                        :B_block:

    for contributing to the discussion

**** This will be formatted as a beamer note                       :B_note:

** Frame 2 (where we will not use columns)

*** Request

    Please test this stuff!

    
** A more complex slide

This slide illustrates the use of Beamer blocks.  The following text,
with its own headline, is displayed in a block:

*** Org mode increases productivity                               :B_theorem:
    :PROPERTIES:
    :BEAMER_env: theorem
    :END:

    - org mode means not having to remember LaTeX commands.
    - it is based on ascii text which is inherently portable.
    - Emacs!

    \hfill \(\qed\)

    

** Two columns
   
*** A block                                           :BMCOL:
    :PROPERTIES:
    :BEAMER_col: 0.4
    :END:
    
- this slide consists of two columns
- the first (left) column has no heading and consists of text
- the second (right) column has an image and is enclosed in an @example@ block
